# Earthquake-Leaflet

In this assignment, I used d3.js, Mapbox, and Leaflet to create a map of earthquake data from the past week. The data was obtained from USGS data, which I accessed using d3. I then made a map using a map tile from the Mapbox API, and applied the data to the map using Leaflet. This included markers, popups, and a legend.

## Prerequisites

The CDNs for d3.js and leaflet.js are linked in `index.html`. Source data was obtained from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

## Built With

* Javascript (d3)
* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation)
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/)
* HTML 5.0

## About USGS
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.
